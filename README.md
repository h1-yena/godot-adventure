This is my little beginner godot project that I am doing. This is basically based on Godot 4: Build a 2D Action-Adventure Game on gamedev.tv by Ahmed Nassef. Huge shoutout to them!

The assets used are from the [Ninja Adventure Asset Pack](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack) on itch.io by Pixel-Boy and AAA.
